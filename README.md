# Case Studies:

Pull in examples of building data-driven applications with SlashTag. Would be cool to create a live project that is a real-world example of how SlashTag can be used. Users can annote it usign SlashTag and then use the data to build a model (perhaps need 3+ users to agree so that it doens't get too noisy).
